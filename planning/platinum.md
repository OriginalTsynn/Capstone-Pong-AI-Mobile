This is where I'll get to have some fun.
Once bronze, silver, and gold are attained, phase 2 starts.
IMMORTAL PONGBAT!

Phase 2:
        1.  give each paddle a health bar
            1.  this will reflect the percentage of remaining paddle left.
            2.  once either side hits 0, PONGALITY is achieved, for an instant point.
            3.  Each restart of the ball will refill paddle and hp
        2.  give each paddle the option to fire a laser
            1.  laser will damage enemy paddle (making that section of the paddle incapable of bouncing the ball back)
        3.  Create power ups that spawn randomly throughout the match
            1.  power up possibilities:
                1.  increase laser width
                    1.  possibly take out a bigger chunk of paddle
                2.  ball multiplier
                    1.  2-7 extra balls will be randomly generated if the power up is hit.
                    2.  These balls will all travel in random direction and velocity once triggered
                    3.  no ball passing the paddle will count for a score unless it's the only remaining ball in play
                3.  nuke
                    1.  any ball passing the paddle edge will detonate in a circle
                    2.  circle will persist momentarily, disentigrating any paddle attempting to traverse it
                4.  heal
                    1.  full heal of your paddle
                5.  Agility
                    1.  increases the acceleration potential of paddle
                6.  gigantism
                    1.  increase height of paddle
                    2.  reduce speed of paddle
                    3.  increase exit accelration from big paddles
        4.  may want an option to allow paddle to rotate on it's axis...
            1.  effect on the ball will be:
                1.  drastic change of acceleration
                2.  drastic change of direction
