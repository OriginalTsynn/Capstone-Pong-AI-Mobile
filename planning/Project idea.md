# Unit 4 project
##  Pong!
##  with AI
##  mobile native app

    Plans so far:
    1.  Research canvas + phaser and implement for pong
        1.  What does pong need?
            1.  2 paddles
            2.  1 ball
            3.  2 boundary walls that cause a bounce
            4.  2 boundary walls that count as a goal
                1.  A scoreboard to keep track of points
            5.  collision physics
            6.  acceleration physics?
    2.  Research machine learning utilizing reinforcement learning
        1.  Things the AI will need to keep track of:
            1.  AI paddle
            2.  ball position
            3.  ball trajectory
            4.  ball velocity
            5.  opponent paddle?
    3.  Research React Native to make it a mobile app
        1.  This may cause a complete refactoring of code, and might not get implemented
